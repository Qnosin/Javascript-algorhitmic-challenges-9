## Javascript algorhitmic challenges #9
nineth exercise of my 100 chalenges in 30 days!!
* Given two arrays of strings a1 and a2 return a sorted array r in lexicographical order of the strings of a1 which are substrings of strings of a2.

* Example 1:
```
a1 = ["arp", "live", "strong"]

a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]

returns ["arp", "live", "strong"]
```
* Example 2:
```
a1 = ["tarp", "mice", "bull"]

a2 = ["lively", "alive", "harp", "sharp", "armstrong"]

```

	
## How to see the results of my solution?
there are 2 ways
* first : install nodeJS for your os from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and type in terminal or cmd 'node script.js'
* second : copy the file to the javascript tab on https://jsbin.com/?html,js,console,output and see the output in the console tab.
